This value is mapped into a gray shade according to this formula

v=clamp(v,LowPass,HighPass)
v=(v-LowPass)/(HighPass-LowPass)
graylevel=GammaCorrection(v,GammaLev)

Some useful hints:

 keys

'c' compute the sampling (sample are added so pressing c twice is the same of using 2n sampling directions)
'S' save a ply with the currently computed color.
's' smooth (average) the computed visibility
' ' add the current view to the sampling direction

'l' Increase LowPass
'L' Decrease LowPass
'h' Increase HighPass
'H' Decrease HighPass
'g' Increase GammaLev
'G' Decrease GammaLev

'a' Toggle Lighting
'A' Toggle per vertex coloring

 options

-n <number> set the number of sampling direction (default 32, but 100~1000 should be better)
-f flip normal of the surface
-z <float> specify the z tolerance used to decide if a vertex is visible against the zbuffer or not (default 1e-4, useful range 1e-3 .. 1e-6)
